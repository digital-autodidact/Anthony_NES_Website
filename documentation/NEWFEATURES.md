## Feature 1: Secret Music Button Feature
- **Status:** üü† PARTIALLY IMPLEMENTED

- **Implementation Ideas**:
  - [X] I want me to place the music button in a location that's mildly out of slight. Let it be a treat for the curious visitors to discover.
  - [X] I'd like for each webpage to play a different melody when its music button is pressed. A different theme for each page!
  - [ ] I feel it'd be cool to build a database of musicbox songs. I'd like to build a feature that selects a different melody to play every time the page is reloaded!

## Feature 4: A Questbook Page
- **Status:** ‚úîÔ∏è IMPLEMENTED
- **Description**: I want me to create a page dedicated to describing my quests.

- **Implementation Ideas**:
    - [x] Create a list of quests to display on the `Questbook` page
    - [x] Create a section within the `Questbook` page to highlight the quests you're currently working on completing (Limit to 3-5 quests)

       - Life Quest (only 1)
       - Main Quests (~7 of these)
       - Side Quests (many)
    - [ ] I'd like to design the appearance of the questbook to resemble the [Adventure Log](https://i.pinimg.com/736x/a3/ea/47/a3ea4733c378fa2b424c16fc3c56d488.jpg) used in Breath of the Wild!

## Feature 5: A Life Philosophy Page
- **Status:** ‚ùå NOT YET IMPLEMENTED
- **Description**: I want to create a page that describes my life philosophy and key beliefs. This feature is inspired by Buster Benson's "Codex Vitae" page and Adam Piggott's "My Personal Beliefs and Opinions" page.
- **Benefits**: If I list out my beliefs in a clear way, people will know exactly who they are dealing with when they visit my sight. I wish to be a polarizing force -- I want to know who my friends are, and who my enemies are, on clear terms

- **Implementation Ideas**:
   - [ ] Implement this as a simple list on a webpage
   - [ ] Write a preface on the page to explain that I will retain the privilege of changing my mind on any belief or attitude I wrote down at any point I desire. See Adam Piggot's first two paragraphs on his page for an example.
   - [ ] Perhaps I can list out my "Code of 20 Principles" on this page too

## Feature 6: A "Pantheon of Role Models" Page
- **Status:** ‚ùå NOT YET IMPLEMENTED
- **Description**: I want to create a page that visually describes the men and women I admire as role models. I want to write a brief bio for them, and explicitly identify the quality I admire them for.
- **Benefits**: Look, I don't know if the visitors will find it cool or not, I don't care. I think it's a cool idea and I want to make it happen on my website somewhere.
- **Implementation Ideas**:
   - [ ] I wish to see this page implemented as a wall of tiled images. Clicking on an image will take the user to a dedicated sub-page that describes the role model's bio

    - Draw portraits for people
    - Design & deliver workshops (I'm willing to teach people how to build tools)
    - Give public talks (I'm willing to come in and deliver talks to small groups)
- **Benefits**: Building a `Hire Me` page would make it easier for visitors to contact me for the purposes of hiring me. I could easily promote my services on this page.

- **Implementation Ideas**:
   - [ ] I could implement this feature as an enhancement of my current `Contact Me` page
   - [ ] It'd be a good idea to present a list of the services I can offer on the page
   - [ ] Add a "call to action" button somewhere on the page
   - [ ] Design the "Services" page to display my services as cards, as shown on this [freeCodeCamp tutorial](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/how-to-create-a-portfolio-website-using-html-css-javascript-and-bootstrap/#heading-how-to-make-the-services-section).
   - [ ] Promote yourself in two ways:
