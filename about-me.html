        <p>I'm a <strong>digital autodidact</strong> and a <strong>playful creator</strong>! I like to learn and create things for fun. You can learn about me here by clicking on the relevant sections!</p>

                Who Am I?
            </h2>
            <div class="toggle-content" style="display: none;">
                <h3>Background</h3>
                <p>I'm a Marine Corps veteran with an IT background. I developed my skills by working in various tech roles ranging from helpdesk technician to network administrator. During my enlistment, I led and trained small teams of junior technicians. I developed a unique blend of technological, investigative and leadership skills that I bring over to my civilian career.</p>

                What Makes Me Special?
            </h2>
            <div class="toggle-content" style="display: none;">
                <h3>I'm a Modern-Day Renaissance Man!</h3>
                <p>What sets me apart is my insatiable curiosity and my unique talent stack! I bring an <strong>eclectic mix of skills and experiences</strong> to every organization I choose to work for.</p>
                <p>I introduce myself as a "digital autodidact" because I'm driven to learn new skills in programming, writing and traditional art.</p>
                <p>This unique talent stack means I'm positioned to bring a holistic approach to solving problems. Whether programming the frontend of a mobile app or painting a person's portrait, I'm always looking to challenge myself to grow as a human being.</p>
            
                <h3>I'm a Man With A Second Brain!</h3>
                <p><em>"What's a second brain?"</em> Glad you asked!</p>
                <p>It's a concept I learned from the productivity expert Tiago Forte. It's a system of tools and methods that help me organize my life and work. I use it to store my ideas, notes, and projects in a way that's easy to access and share.</p>
                <p>My second brain system is a centralized repository of my best ideas, insights and thoughts, which exists outside of my head (ie the "first" brain)</p>
                <p>Think of it like a personal wiki where I create FAQs on different subjects!</p>
                <p>The system is designed to augment my natural memory, and more importantly, free up my first brain (the one between my ears) to focus entirely on thinking and learning effectively.</p>
