                <p>A quest is a <strong>journey or mission undertaken by an individual</strong> to achieve a specific goal or obtain a significant object or knowledge. Quests involve challenges, obstacles, and adventures that test the abilities and resolve of the individual.</p>
                <p>In literature, quests are commonly associated with fantasy, where characters embark on epic journeys to find treasure, rescue someone, or fulfill a prophecy.</p>
                <p>Quests can be physical, mental, or emotional in nature.</p>
                <p>Quests can be simple or complex, and can involve a wide range of activities, from exploring new places to solving puzzles to battling enemies.</p>

                    <p>The key elements of a quest are a <strong>journey, a conflict, and an object to attain.</strong></p>
                    <p>Designing a quest Sis my favorite way of setting a goal and motivating myself to achieve it. A good quest should have the following elements:</p>
                    <div class="lists">
                        <ul class="nes-list is-disc">

                            <p><em>There should be a clear treasure or reward at the end of the quest to take back with you</em></p>
                            <li>a journey</li>
                            <p><em>Typically involves travel</em></p>
                            <li>a conflict</li>
                            <p><em>Requires you to overcome obstacles or navigate a confrontation. Can be physical or psychological conflict</em></p>
                            <li>an object to attain</li>
                            <p><em>There should be a clear treasure or reward at the end of the quest to take back with you</em></p>
                        </ul>

                    Why Pursue A Quest?
                </h3>
                <div class="toggle-content" style="display: none;">
                    <quote>"What would have become of Hercules do you think if there had been no lion, hydra, stag or boar - and no savage criminals to rid the world of? What would he have done in the absence of such challenges?

                        Obviously he would have just rolled over in bed and gone back to sleep. So by snoring his life away in luxury and comfort he never would have developed into the mighty Hercules.
                        
                        And even if he had, what good would it have done him? What would have been the use of those arms, that physique, and that noble soul, without crises or conditions to stir into him action?"
                    </quote>
                    <p>I invent and pursue quests for simple reasons:</p>
                    <div class="lists">
                        <ul class="nes-list is-disc">
                            <li>I like to amuse myself by inventing stories. It's all play to me.</li>
                            <li>Self-improving is easier when I invent narratives that make me feel like the main character of a RPG. It helps me feel something other than a cog in a giant machine.</li>

                <p>A questbook is a book containing a list of quests. It is an enhanced version of a bucket list, wherein every desire is written in a specific format that's tailored for questing.</p>
                <p>Additionally, each quest is illustrated with a little goal image that symbolizes the activity involved in the quest.</p>

                    <p>My ultimate quest is to become a <strong>digital autodidact</strong> -- a self-taught learner who uses digital tools and resources to acquire knowledge and skills in various areas.</p>
